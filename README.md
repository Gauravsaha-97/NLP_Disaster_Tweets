# NLP_Disaster_Tweets

In this project, I have tried to implement a RNN Model using Tensorflow to predict whether a tweet is about real disasters or not. Initially, for this project, I have dropped some columns like ['id','keyword','location'] from the dataset and tried to make predictions solely based upon the text. Although, all these columns can be considered to come up with a better model to achieve high accuracy. The dataset is downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data)
